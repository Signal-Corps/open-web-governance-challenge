# Project Summary

Signal Corps' proposal, D.E.S.A. (Delegate | Elect | Signal | Award), is a governance model for how the NEAR Community Fund can be redesigned to make more community-informed collective decisions in how it awards funding to support the NEAR ecosystem of communities, DAOs, and Guilds.

# Overview

A high-level overview of the process is outlined in four summary stages below:

* Delegate: Credit distribution/delegation. This step is used to define the 'community' for the round/term (* a term is expected to be quarterly and each round will be monthly). The # of credits an individual is delegated will determine voting weight in the Elect stage and how many credits are able to allocate in the Signal stage .
* Elect: Voting to elect the community-based representatives to the council.
* Signal: Community-based quadratic-voting of different grant proposals submitted for the present round.
* Award: Hybrid Executive + Elected Council voting to determine whether a proposal is awarded funds. Threshold for approving funds impacted by proposals' relative votes received in Signal stage.
