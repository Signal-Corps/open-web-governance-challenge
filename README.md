# Project Summary

Inspired by the RadicalxChange Foundations' RXC Voice platform, the Signal Corps team is designing a similar yet distinct governance process for the NEAR Community Fund. While RXC Voice is designed to democratically determine the RadicalxChange's yearly strategic priorities with broad participation from the community, Signal Corps' proposal for the NEAR Community Fund is designed to enhance and make more community-informed collective decisions in how it awards funding to support the NEAR ecosystem of communities, DAOs, and Guilds.

Signal Corps' goals for this hackathon include:

* Develop whitepaper and corresponding infographic/wireframes to visually guide the reader through the proposed governance process.
* Detail not only the system-wide features, but also include examples of different user personas' perspectives (e.g. community participants, council member).
* Engage with members of the NEAR community and others interested in open web governance.

# Overview

A high-level overview of the process is outlined in four summary stages below and depicted in the following link:

* Delegate: Credit distribution/delegation. This step is used to define the 'community' for the round/term (* a term is expected to be quarterly and each round will be monthly). The # of credits an individual is delegated will determine voting weight in the Elect stage and how many credits are able to allocate in the Signal stage .
* Elect: Voting to elect the community-based representatives to the council.
* Signal: Community-based quadratic-voting of different grant proposals submitted for the present round.
* Award: Hybrid Executive + Elected Council voting to determine whether a proposal is awarded funds. Threshold for approving funds impacted by proposals' relative votes received in Signal stage.
